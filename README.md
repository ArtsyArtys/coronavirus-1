# Create Web App
        This app was initialized with Create Web App, the purpose of which is to remove the strain of creating all the boilerplate
        for a new web project and standardize the filesystem architecture. Simply pick what initial setup you have, install any additional tools
        you would like to use, and start coding, like this person did!
